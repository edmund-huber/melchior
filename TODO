. add a 'help' (that also gets triggered for nonsense), that
  will introspect and print docstrings of methods

. add a 'tasks' that help you keep track of how long you take on what things

. multiple channel support

. arbitrary JSON dump per-method so that restarts dont make sad --

  @melchior.store(mystore='mydump.js')
  @melchior.responder
  def whachoo_say(who, msg):
    if who in mystore: # mystore is magically in scope
      last = mystore[who]
      mystore[who] = msg
      return '%s: last time you said "%s"' % (who, last)
    else:
      mystore[who] = msg

. instead of 'return (a single string)', either yield or return a list of strings.
